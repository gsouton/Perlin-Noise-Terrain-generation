					I was always intrigued by procedural generation and was interested in how some of those techniques were developed.
					</br> 
					The cases where I encountered procedural generation were mostly in video games for terrains and map generation.
			 	</p>

				 <p>
					I knew that heightmaps were used to generate and visualize terrains, however, I didn't know how those heightmaps were created.
					So I went to read about <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heightmap">heightmaps</a> on Wikipedia and found methods such as <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlin_noise">Perlin Noise </a>  
					and the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond-square_algorithm"> Diamond-square algorithm</a>.

				 <p>
					The algorithm felt like magic at first, so I decided to do more research and try to have a better understanding.
					I found  multiple articles and ressources on the subject, such as the original paper of
					<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://mrl.cs.nyu.edu/~perlin/paper445.pdf">Ken Perlin</a> on the improved version of his algorithm.
				 </p>
				 <h1 class="subtitle">Heightmaps</h1>
				 <p>
					If you already know what is a heightmap you can skip this part &#x1F609 .
				 </p>
				 <p>
					 To summarize quite fast a heightmap is a lightweight and easy way to store information about terrain elevations.
					 It can be a colored or gray scale image depending on the level of details, where each color is mapped to a certain height.
					 That's all that's needed.  
				 </p>

				 <h1 class="subtitle">Noise</h1>
				 <p>Even though I knew that there were algorithms 
					 and techniques specially used for this purposed I still wanted to see how random noise looked like.</p>
				<p> 
					So I went to my keyboard and generated a random picture in grayscale made out of completely random values.
					Then mapped this picture as a texture on a plane to visualize it, and added some colors too.
					Here's the result.
				</p>
				<figure id="noiseFigure" class="figure">
					<div id="noiseGUI"></div>
					<canvas id="noise"></canvas>
					<figcaption>You can click to drag the plane</figcaption>
					<script src="./noise.js" type="module"></script>
				</figure>
				<p>
					It is pretty random and does not look like anything close to a terrain even with the colors...
				</p>

				 <h1 class="subtitle">Perlin Noise</h1>
				 <p>First I need to say that through this lecture I'm not trying to explain the algorithms in detail here, 
					 you can find people that already did that in a way better way than I would, you can check my <a href="#source">sources</a>.</p>
				 <p>
					The algorithm of Ken Perlin takes as input two numbers representing $(x, y)$ coordinate 
					and returns a pseudo-random value between 0 and 1. <span class="detail">(actually it is a value between $[-\sqrt(N/4), \sqrt(N/4)]$ where N is the number of dimensions. But in my case, the value is brought back in the range [0, 1]. 
					The math can be found <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://digitalfreepen.com/2017/06/20/range-perlin-noise.html">here</a>)</span>
				 </p>
				 <p>
					 To understand the algorithm we can visualize each step :
					 <li class="list">
						Create a grid of random unit vectors
					 </li>
					 <li class="list">
						The point passed in parameters will be located in one of the cells of the grid.
						Find those corners and compute the dot product between the vector of each corner with the offset vector (offset vector = topLeftVector - inputVector)
					 </li>
					 <li class="list">
						 Finally, do an interpolation between the dot products.
					 </li>
				 </p>
				 <p>
					After having a general understanding of the algorithm,
					I decided to implement this algorithm and started to implement the non-improved version of the algorithm.
				 </p>
				 <figure id="perlinFigure" class="figure">
					 <div id="perlinGUI"></div>
					<canvas id="perlin"></canvas>
					<figcaption>You can click to drag the plane</figcaption>	
				 	<script src="./perlin.js" type="module"></script>
				 </figure>

				 <p>
					At first, the result looks a bit odd (octaves = 1). </br>
					That's where I discovered that you can add noise together (octaves).</br>
					When the octaves increase, I'm adding the noise to itself to create more complex and natural-like patterns.</br><br>
					This version is working quite fine, but it is known to be slower than the improved version so
					let's implement the improved version of this algorithm.
					The original code implementation written by Ken Perlin can be found
					<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://mrl.cs.nyu.edu/~perlin/noise/">here</a>.
				 </p>

				 <h1>Improved Perlin Noise</h1>
				 <p>
					 The main differences between the improved version and the last version:
					 <li class="list">
						The interpolant has been changed.
					 </li>
					 <li class="list">
						 The vectors are not chosen randomly anymore.
						 Now each vector is chosen between one that leads to an edge of the grid. 
					 </li>
					 <li class="list">
						 The use of a permutation table.
					 </li>
				 </p>
				 

				 <p>
					In the implementation of Ken Perlin, the algorithm is computed in 3 dimensions, however since I'm generating a texture I only need 2 dimensions.<br>
					So needed to rewrite this code to work with only two dimensions and here we are!

				 </p>
				 <figure id="improvedPerlinFigure" class="figure">
					<div id="improvedPerlinGUI"></div>
					<canvas id="improvedPerlin"></canvas>
					<script src="improvedPerlin.js" type="module"></script>
				 </figure>
				 <p>
					As mentioned by Ken Perlin in his article, this version is faster and has a better distribution of gradients.
					Now that this algorithm is implemented it is possible to generate those pseudo-random textures with a natural look.
				 </p>
				 

				 <h1>Mesh</h1>
				 <p>Now that we can generate random heightmaps that look more natural and not like a random mess, we can start to generate meshes.</p>
				 <p>In this case the brighter the color the higher it is (so a white pixel is a high point in the map and a black pixel is the lowest point)</p>
				 <p>So the main idea is to generate a plane with numerous amount of vertices and to elevate each vertice depending on the color that has been read.</p>

				<h1>Conclusion</h1>
				<p>
					That's all for now.
					
				
					I always wanted to explore and discover techniques used in computer graphics.
					I think I will do more computer graphics related experiments soon, but this was a nice and gentle way to start.
