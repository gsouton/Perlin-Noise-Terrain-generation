# Computer graphics

This repository is where I explore concepts or techniques used in computer graphics.
For now it is only about Perlin Noise and procedural generation, but more is to come.

## Perlin Noise and procedural generation
I experimented with Perlin Noise and terrain generation, the code for this is located in Heightmap/
You have details on implementation and research that I did here:
