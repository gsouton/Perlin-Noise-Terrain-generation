# Computer graphics

This repository is where I explore concepts or techniques used in computer graphics.
For now it is only about Perlin Noise and procedural generation, but more is to come.
If in the future the repository becomes to big, I might split it in multiple differents repos.



## Perlin Noise and procedural generation
I experimented with Perlin Noise and terrain generation, the code for this is located in Heightmap/
You have details on what I did here: https://gsouton.github.io/ComputerGraphics/
